## OpenLayers Tutorial

This repo contains the tutorial code for Udemy course [OpenLayers 6 from scratch with a Project](https://github.com/PuuperttiRuma/openlayers-tutorial).

**Technologies**: React with Vite, OpenLayers

### Learning Report
Doing the course caught me the following concepts and skills:
- The key concepts of OpenLayers:
  - How to create Maps and how to add Views, Layers, Overlays, Interactions and Controls to them
- How to add Raster Layers from external sources using different kinds of sources
  - OpenStreetmaps
  - ArcGISRest
  - TileWMS
- How to use the OpenLayers documentation
- How to use OpenLayers and other vanilla JavaScript libraries in React

The original course is several years old, so many of the sample materials used are not available online anymore. To combat this, I needed to find different sources for some of the raster layers.

List of sources needing a new sample:
- ArcGISRest
- TileWMS
